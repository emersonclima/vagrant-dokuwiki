# vagrant-dokuwiki

A vagrant file with dokuwiki (arch + lighttpd + php-fpm) ready for production.

I made this project because I use wiki for knowledgment management and love minimalists softwares like DokuWiki.

## Deployment

Download a version of DokuWiki at their official website an place it at dokuwiki subfolder (just extract the file).

Make sure you have Vagrant installed and operational in your machine. Then just enter this in this project folder:

`$ vagrant up`
  
See DokuWiki in your browser at http://192.138.33.10
